The book perfectly fits the objective of representing connections since it references and talks about objects pertaining to the culture of the mid-60s from the point of view of Edoardo Sanguineti, one of the main intellectuals in Italy at that time. In particular, the objects and items referenced within the book pertain to different domains, ranging from artworks to advertising, cinema, journals, music, and so on. Even if most of the objects pertain to contemporary culture and reflect mass-media production, there are also references to items born in different times.  To describe every cultural object Sanguineti uses the form of ekphrasis, a literary genre that has as the main topic the description of an artwork, real or imagined.</p> <p>Evolution of the ekphrasis from ancient to modern times (Cometa); taxonomy (Cometa); not only a description but a way of seeing (Elsner); ekphrasis in Sanguineti: false unity of the subject (\u201cio\u201d) (Sotgiu) in comparison with the actors of the ekphrasis described by (Cometa); also, about ekphrasis in Sanguineti (Portesine) (\u201ctutto \u00e8 ecfrasi\u201d, says Sanguineti).</p> <p>Il Giuoco dell\u2019Oca is therefore a text containing intermedial references (Rajewsky) but also intratextual references, connecting chapters. All these relations are of different kind and can be modeled to make them meaningful. We model the relations according to interpretation acts by scholars who studied Sanguineti\u2019s ekphrasis. </p> <p>Our model: 1) from abstract to concrete objects: FRBR-WEMI, FaBiO and RDA for the description of the items 2) intermedial and intratextual references with respect to the (FRBR) LRMoo model, reusing CIDOC-CRM and CiTO 3) interpretation acts by scholars: HiCO and PROV-O</p>"},{"location":"domain/items/","title":"Items","text":"<p>Balance variety (GLAM domain) and representativeness for the domain.</p> <p>We operated a selection within the total amount of cultural objects described in the ekphrasis and recognized by the scholars applying three selection criteria: first, objects have to be published on the web with their metadata by a cultural institution responsible for the curation of the object and the data. Second, objects metadata had to follow a standardized description, preferably some kind of international standards for metadata. Lastly, the selection had to contain a balanced variety of objects coming from the GLAM domain. In addition to these criteria, we also considered scholarly interpretations to guide our search so that items included in the sample exemplify intermedial references within the ekphrasis and even external and wider relations to be modeled. </p> <p>The final selection is composed by 14 items, including Sanguineti text itself and two other cultural objects not mentioned within the chapters but related to the work \u201cIl Giuoco dell\u2019Oca\u201d as well: one is the board game \u201cGame of the Goose\u201d from which Sanguineti is inspired by, the other is the artwork by the Italian artist Gianfranco Baruchello titled \u201cIl Giuoco dell\u2019Oca di Edoardo Sanguineti\u201d, conceived after and in honor of his friend\u2019s novel, recreating the traditional board game in a new way.

As of January 2025, the main frameworks that have integrated the LRM into Linked Open Data are Bibliographic Framework Initiative (BIBFRAME), Resource Description and Access (RDA) and Library Reference Model object-oriented (LRMoo).</p> <ul> <li> <p>BIBFRAME was developed in 2012 by the U.S. Library of Congress as a linked data alternative to MARC for the creation of bibliographic data. Expressed in RDF, it is based on three core categories of abstraction (work, instance, item), where work collapses LRM's work and expression entities. While we can see the reasons for this simplification, since bibliographic data describe works in terms of publication (manifestation) and edition (expression), we required the distinction between work as an artistic endeavor and expression as the result of an edition. For example, the contribution of editor Valerio Riva, as distinct from that of author Edoardo Sanguineti, to the first edition of Il Giuoco dell'Oca would be flattened not considering the two levels as separate. Similarly, it could not be clearly represented how Magdalo Mussio's article in Marcatr\u00e8 is a \u201csketched\u201d version of his animated film Go for your money. For this reason, we could not integrate BIBFRAME into our model.</p> </li> <li> <p>RDA was released in 2010 as the new standard for descriptive cataloging in the U.S., a successor to the second edition of the Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules, and is jointly managed by a committee of Anglophone library associations, despite being the reference in an increasing number of other countries. In 2014, the vocabularies that represent RDA entities and controlled terminologies were published as RDF element sets in RDA Registry. The RDA data model adopts LRM as its theoretical underpinning and faithfully reproduces its structure with domain and range constraints. Its RDF representation provides rich detail relationship designators through a hierarchy of subproperties from general to specific and ensures interoperability with other Semantic Web initiatives by mapping its properties as subproperties of both LRMer properties and Dublin Core Terms. In addition to LRM properties, RDA includes several elements to accommodate additional information needed or currently part of the cataloging practice. For the sake of flexibility, its properties are further declared as both datatype and object properties, and can therefore be used with literals and other entities alike.</p> </li> <li> <p>LRMoo succeds the 2010 FRBRoo model, its first official release was approved in 2024 and has been appointed by IFLA as a preferred implementation of the LRM. It translates the LRM entities and relationships into the formal ontology of ICOM's CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CRM), enabling alignment with cultural heritage data standards and facilitating integration between museum and bibliographic datasets. The CIDOC CRM is the most widely used ontology in cultural heritage modeling, and is particularly well suited for representing complex cultural object production events with nuanced designations of temporal relationships, part-whole inferences and roles of the agents involved, the latter thanks to the extension of properties with types (reification). Being an object-oriented, event-centered framework, to describe a cultural object a strict application must forcibly pass through production events and entities representing appellations, time-spans, and the like. In LRMoo, these are multiplied because the cultural object itself is already conceptually separated into multiple levels, each requiring its own related event.</p> </li> </ul> <p>We identified RDA and LRMoo as the two main ontologies that we could reuse in our model. To test the potential and critical aspects of each, we modeled the metadata of the most complex item in our domain\u2014a comics magazine\u2014as precisely as possible, applying the two ontologies separately.</p>"},{"location":"knowledge-organization/formal-model/#modelling-of-serials","title":"Modelling of Serials","text":"<p>Modelling a comics magazine is challenging because it is a periodical that in specialized sources is described analytically, as each story within it has different subjects and authors, often masked behind pseudonyms.</p> <p>In the Library Reference Model, serials\u2014publications issued in parts, regardless of regularity or frequency, of which periodicals as a subset\u2014are complex constructs that combine whole/part relationships and aggregation relationships. A serial work has a whole/part relationship with the individual issues published over time, while each issue expression is an aggregate of articles.</p> <p>The whole/part relationship is hierarchical and structural: it describes a situation where a whole entity is composed of discrete parts that contribute to its existence, are integral to its identity, and cannot typically exist independently in the same context, such as chapters in a book. In contrast, the aggregation relationship is associative, grouping together expressions that remain independent, can exist separately, and each realize their own work, as short stories within an anthology. In the case of serials, the serial work provides the overarching issuing plan, which informs the aggregation of each individual issue.</p> <p>According to IFLA LRM, a work is defined as having a certain commonality of content among its expressions. For serials, this commonality \u201cresides in both the publisher\u2019s and the editor\u2019s intention to convey the feeling to end-users that all individual issues do belong to an identifiable whole, and in the collection of editorial concepts (a title, an overall topic, a recognizable layout, a regular frequency, etc.) that will help to convey that feeling.\u201d<sup>1</sup> This inherent characterization of serial works by their publication features\u2014such as title, language, and publisher\u2014means that any variation in these features results in the identification of a new serial work.</p> <p>Reflecting this intrinsic link between the serial work and its defining publication features, LRM enforces the \u201cWEM lock\u201d: a cardinality restriction specifying that a serial work is realized by one and only one expression, which is embodied by one and only one manifestation. For this reason, an article is not considered a part of a periodical but is the expression of its own work. This expression is aggregated within the expression of an issue, whose work is part of the serial work.</p> <p>In this model test, we limited ourselves to the description of the cover of issue 26 of Young Romance, the piece that Richard Hamilton chose to include in the iconic collage that started pop art. For the diagrams we used RDF Diagram, a Draw.io plugin (written in Rust!) that allows for real-time syntax validation and conversion in Turtle. We thank the Institute for Applied Informatics (InfAI) of Leipzig for sharing such a useful tool.</p>"},{"location":"knowledge-organization/formal-model/#lrmoo-in-action","title":"LRMoo in action","text":"<p>Modelling periodicals in LRMoo is currently limited by the fact that PRESSoo, the extension dedicated specifically to this, has not yet been updated to LRM and is only available in an earlier version based on FRBR and incompatible with the most recent version (7.1.3) of CIDOC CRM, so we chose not to use it. PRESSoo would offer the possibility of describing the planning aspects of a serial work (thanks to the extension of the \u201cforsees use of\u201d properties), although in our case, in which the periodical is not only described as a whole but the perusal of single articles is carried out, this information can be included in the issue description.

For the sake of this example, all concepts were drawn from Getty's Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus, as it is a widely used resource in the cultural heritage domain. For brevity, some entities connected to objects are nested, and their details can be expanded by clicking the plus sign.

of properties with controlled vocabularies to assign the correct type designation to each WEMI level: category/genre for work, content type (i.e., the medium it is intended for) for expression, physical description of material and extent for manifestation. Serial work does not have a dedicated class but is defined by the properties \u201chas extension plan\u201d and \u201chas frequency,\u201d plus the designation of the issue number with \u201chas numbering within sequence.\u201d The issue is traced back to the magazine by the specific property \u201chas issue,\u201d which establishes a partitive relation.</p> <p>The flexibility to choose between datatype and object properties as needed allows not to create entities for individual name variants when not relevant, but also to do so in cases such as the shared pseudonym \u201cJon Henri.\u201d However, it should be noted that making this distinction explicit in the ontology would require specifying, case by case, which type of property is being employed. This is achieved by using distinct namespaces\u2014such as <code>rdamo:</code> for object properties and <code>rdamd:</code> for datatype properties\u2014both of which have the manifestation class as their domain. Moreover, a downside of the model's lack of typed properties is that, to express more artist-specific roles such as penciler and inker, it would need to be extended.</p> See RDF triples Describing Periodicals with RDA<pre><code>@prefix : &lt;https://f3mf.github.io/gdo/test-rda#&gt;.\n\n@prefix dc: &lt;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/&gt;.\n@prefix rdfs: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#&gt;.\n@prefix xsd: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#&gt;.\n\n@prefix rdaa: &lt;http://rdaregistry.info/Elements/a/&gt;.\n@prefix rdac: &lt;http://rdaregistry.info/Elements/c/&gt;.\n@prefix rdae: &lt;http://rdaregistry.info/Elements/e/&gt;.\n@prefix rdai: &lt;http://rdaregistry.info/Elements/i/&gt;.\n@prefix rdam: &lt;http://rdaregistry.info/Elements/m/&gt;.\n@prefix rdan: &lt;http://rdaregistry.info/Elements/n/&gt;.\n@prefix rdaw: &lt;http://rdaregistry.info/Elements/w/&gt;.\n\n@prefix rdacc: &lt;http://rdaregistry.info/termList/RDAColourContent/&gt;.\n@prefix rdaco: &lt;http://rdaregistry.info/termList/RDAContentType/&gt;.\n@prefix rdaep: &lt;http://rdaregistry.info/termList/RDAExtensionPlan/&gt;.\n@prefix rdafr: &lt;http://rdaregistry.info/termList/frequency/&gt;.\n@prefix rdatb: &lt;http://rdaregistry.info/termList/RDATypeOfBinding/&gt;.\n@prefix rdamat: &lt;http://rdaregistry.info/termList/RDAMaterial/&gt;.\n\n@prefix lcsh: &lt;http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects&gt;.\n@prefix lcgft: &lt;http://id.loc.gov/authorities/genreForms/&gt;.\n@prefix gn: &lt;https://sws.geonames.org/&gt;.\n\n&lt;https://f3mf.github.io/gdo/test-rda#&gt;\n    dc:creator \"Francesca Massarenti\";\n    dc:date \"2025-01-12\";\n    dc:description \"A test of the descriptive capabilities of the RDA ecosystem, taking as a case study the perusal of a periodical, the most complex publication to model within LRM.\"@en;\n    dc:title \"Describing Periodicals with RDA\"@en.\n\n:ben-oda a rdac:C10004;\n    rdaa:P50115 \"Ben Kazuhito Oda\";\n    rdaa:P50117 \"Ben Oda\";\n    rdaa:P50118 gn:5097672;\n    rdaa:P50119 gn:5392114;\n    rdaa:P50120 \"1984-11-28T00:00:00\"^^xsd:dateTime;\n    rdaa:P50121 \"1915-12-21T00:00:00\"^^xsd:dateTime;\n    rdaa:P50291 \"Oda\";\n    rdaa:P50292 \"Ben\";\n    rdfs:label \"Ben Oda\".\n\n:feature-publications a rdac:C10005;\n    rdaa:P50025 \"A Prize Publication\"@en,\n        \"Prize Group\"@en;\n    rdaa:P50041 \"Feature Publications\"@en;\n    rdfs:label \"Feature Publications\"@en.\n\n:jack-kirby a rdac:C10004;\n    rdaa:P50103 \"Jacob Kurtzberg\";\n    rdaa:P50117 \"Jack Kirby\";\n    rdaa:P50118 gn:5402405;\n    rdaa:P50119 gn:5128581;\n    rdaa:P50120 \"1994-02-06T00:00:00\"^^xsd:dateTime;\n    rdaa:P50121 \"1917-08-28T00:00:00\"^^xsd:dateTime;\n    rdaa:P50291 \"Kirby\";\n    rdaa:P50292 \"Jack\";\n    rdaa:P50428 :jon-henri;\n    rdfs:label \"Jack Kirby\".\n\n:joe-simon a rdac:C10004;\n    rdaa:P50103 \"Hymie Simon\";\n    rdaa:P50117 \"Joe Simon\";\n    rdaa:P50118 gn:5128581;\n    rdaa:P50119 gn:5134086;\n    rdaa:P50120 \"2011-12-14T00:00:00\"^^xsd:dateTime;\n    rdaa:P50121 \"1913-10-11T00:00:00\"^^xsd:dateTime;\n    rdaa:P50291 \"Simon\";\n    rdaa:P50292 \"Joe\";\n    rdaa:P50428 :jon-henri;\n    rdfs:label \"Joe Simon\".\n\n:jon-henri a rdac:C10012;\n    rdan:P80068 \"Jon Henri\".\n\n:young-romance-26-cover-e a rdac:C10006;\n    rdae:P20006 \"en-US\"^^xsd:language;\n    rdae:P20387 :ben-oda;\n    rdfs:label \"Cover of Young Romance 26\"@en.\n\n:young-romance-26-cover-w a rdac:C10001;\n    rdaw:P10078 :young-romance-26-cover-e;\n    rdaw:P10088 \"We've got to keep our love a secret, Marge...\"@en;\n    rdaw:P10256 lcsh:sh92001504;\n    rdaw:P10451 :jack-kirby,\n        :joe-simon;\n    rdfs:label \"We've got to keep our love a secret, Marge...\"@en.\n\n:young-romance-26-e a rdac:C10006;\n    rdae:P20001 rdaco:1014,\n        rdaco:1020;\n    rdae:P20059 :young-romance-26-m;\n    rdae:P20319 :young-romance-26-cover-e;\n    rdae:P20338 :jack-kirby,\n        :joe-simon;\n    rdfs:label \"Young Romance 26, Edited\"@en.\n\n:young-romance-26-m a rdac:C10007;\n    rdam:P30011 \"1950-10-01T00:00:00\"^^xsd:dateTime;\n    rdam:P30014 \"no. 26\",\n        \"vol. 4, no. 2\";\n    rdam:P30088 gn:5110629;\n    rdam:P30169 \"standard Golden Age U.
