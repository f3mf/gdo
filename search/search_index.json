The book perfectly fits the objective of representing connections since it references and talks about objects pertaining to the culture of the mid-60s from the point of view of Edoardo Sanguineti, one of the main intellectuals in Italy at that time. In particular, the objects and items referenced within the book pertain to different domains, ranging from artworks to advertising, cinema, journals, music, and so on. Even if most of the objects pertain to contemporary culture and reflect mass-media production, there are also references to items born in different times.  To describe every cultural object Sanguineti uses the form of ekphrasis, a literary genre that has as the main topic the description of an artwork, real or imagined.</p> <p>Evolution of the ekphrasis from ancient to modern times (Cometa); taxonomy (Cometa); not only a description but a way of seeing (Elsner); ekphrasis in Sanguineti: false unity of the subject (\u201cio\u201d) (Sotgiu) in comparison with the actors of the ekphrasis described by (Cometa); also, about ekphrasis in Sanguineti (Portesine) (\u201ctutto \u00e8 ecfrasi\u201d, says Sanguineti).</p> <p>Il Giuoco dell\u2019Oca is therefore a text containing intermedial references (Rajewsky) but also intratextual references, connecting chapters. All these relations are of different kind and can be modeled to make them meaningful. We model the relations according to interpretation acts by scholars who studied Sanguineti\u2019s ekphrasis. </p> <p>Our model: 1) from abstract to concrete objects: FRBR-WEMI, FaBiO and RDA for the description of the items 2) intermedial and intratextual references with respect to the (FRBR) LRMoo model, reusing CIDOC-CRM and CiTO 3) interpretation acts by scholars: HiCO and PROV-O</p>"},{"location":"domain/items/","title":"Items","text":"<p>Balance variety (GLAM domain) and representativeness for the domain.</p> <p>We operated a selection within the total amount of cultural objects described in the ekphrasis and recognized by the scholars applying three selection criteria: first, objects have to be published on the web with their metadata by a cultural institution responsible for the curation of the object and the data. Second, objects metadata had to follow a standardized description, preferably some kind of international standards for metadata. Lastly, the selection had to contain a balanced variety of objects coming from the GLAM domain. In addition to these criteria, we also considered scholarly interpretations to guide our search so that items included in the sample exemplify intermedial references within the ekphrasis and even external and wider relations to be modeled. </p> <p>The final selection is composed by 14 items, including Sanguineti text itself and two other cultural objects not mentioned within the chapters but related to the work \u201cIl Giuoco dell\u2019Oca\u201d as well: one is the board game \u201cGame of the Goose\u201d from which Sanguineti is inspired by, the other is the artwork by the Italian artist Gianfranco Baruchello titled \u201cIl Giuoco dell\u2019Oca di Edoardo Sanguineti\u201d, conceived after and in honor of his friend\u2019s novel, recreating the traditional board game in a new way. All items are accompanied by metadata following, when possible, international standard, otherwise those built on proprietary schema have been aligned with the a proper standard selected among those used in the corresponding domain.</p> <p>problems connected with contemporary objects: not described properly - copyright problems - lack of digital reproductions (images), just metadata</p>"},{"location":"domain/items/#1-il-giuoco-delloca","title":"1.
