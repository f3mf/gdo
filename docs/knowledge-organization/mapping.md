# Mapping

While the cataloging standard dictates which fields are populated and in what manner, the meaning of the fields is intrinsic to the MARC format. For precise alignment, we found it more effective to map the bibliographic record formats themselves rather than the cataloging standards.

Putting ourselves in this
detective spirit, the basic questions we need to ask to analyze a proposition P
are similar to the famous Wh-questions: What is responsible for making P true?
When and Where will P be true? Of course, the answers to these questions
depend on the kinds of properties and relations we use in our language.


Distinzione tra subject e relation, confusa nei record bibliografici. Bene genre form terms di LoC.
