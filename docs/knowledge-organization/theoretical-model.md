# Data interpretation

## Theoretical model
The theoretical model illustrates the transition from observation to interpretation within the domain, expliciting the specific types of relationships that exist between chapters and items (i.e. ekphrastic relations) and between different cultural objects (i.e. intermedial relations).

## Enriched E/R model
On the basis of the theoretical model, the E/R model was refined adding all kinds of the relationships at a higher level of abstraction.
