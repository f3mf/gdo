# Conceptual map

The conceptual map illustrates the project's idea, focusing on the three key aspects of the domain:

- The description of _Il Giuoco dell'Oca_ by Edoardo Sanguineti;
- The description of the selected items related to the text, highlighting the chapters in which these items are described and emphasizing the intratextual connections among chapters arising from connection to the same objects;
- The intermedial relationships between the described cultural objects and the other objects to which they are related.

# Entity-relationship model

The E/R model is the translation of the conceptual map in abstract entities (i.e. people, places, dates, and concepts/types) along with their relationships. We organized the three key aspects of our concept into different levels of description within the domain: main text level, text-object level, object-object level.
