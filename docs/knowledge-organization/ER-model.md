# Conceptual map
The conceptual map illustrates the project's idea, focusing on the three key aspects of the domain: 
<br>a. The description of <em>Il Giuoco dell'Oca</em> by Edoardo Sanguineti;
<br>b. The description of the selected items related to the text, highlighting the chapters in which these items are described and emphasizing the intratextual connections among chapters;
<br>c. The intermedial relationships between the described cultural objects and the other objects to which they are related.

# Entity-relationship model
The E/R model is the translation of the conceptual map in abstract entities (i.e. people, places, dates, and concepts/types) along with their relationships. In this context, the enhanced descriptions allowed for the translation of the three key aspects into different levels of description within the domain (i.e. main text level; text-object level; object-object level).
