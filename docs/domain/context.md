# Context

The project focuses on the work “Il Giuoco dell’Oca” written by Edoardo Sanguineti and published in 1967. The book perfectly fits the objective of representing connections since it references and talks about objects pertaining to the culture of the mid-60s from the point of view of Edoardo Sanguineti, one of the main intellectuals in Italy at that time.
In particular, the objects and items referenced within the book pertain to different domains, ranging from artworks to advertising, cinema, journals, music, and so on. Even if most of the objects pertain to contemporary culture and reflect mass-media production, there are also references to items born in different times. 
To describe every cultural object Sanguineti uses the form of ekphrasis, a literary genre that has as the main topic the description of an artwork, real or imagined.

Evolution of the ekphrasis from ancient to modern times (Cometa); taxonomy (Cometa); not only a description but a way of seeing (Elsner); ekphrasis in Sanguineti: false unity of the subject (“io”) (Sotgiu) in comparison with the actors of the ekphrasis described by (Cometa); also, about ekphrasis in Sanguineti (Portesine) (“tutto è ecfrasi”, says Sanguineti).

Il Giuoco dell’Oca is therefore a text containing intermedial references (Rajewsky) but also intratextual references, connecting chapters. All these relations are of different kind and can be modeled to make them meaningful. We model the relations according to interpretation acts by scholars who studied Sanguineti’s ekphrasis. 

Our model: 1) from abstract to concrete objects: FRBR-WEMI, FaBiO and RDA for the description of the items 2) intermedial and intratextual references with respect to the (FRBR) LRMoo model, reusing CIDOC-CRM and CiTO 3) interpretation acts by scholars: HiCO and PROV-O
