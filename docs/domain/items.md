# Items

We conducted a selection from the total number of cultural objects described in the ekphrasis and recognized by scholars, using three specific criteria:

  1. The objects had to be published online with their metadata by a cultural institution responsible for their curation;
  2. The metadata for these objects needed to adhere to a standardized description, ideally following international standards for metadata;

  3. The selection was required to include a balanced variety of objects from the GLAM domain.

Additionally, we took scholarly interpretations into account to guide our search, ensuring that the items included in the sample exemplify intermedial references within the ekphrasis, along with broader external relations that could be modeled.

Ultimately, the final selection consists of 14 items, including Sanguineti's text itself and two other cultural objects related to _Il Giuoco dell’Oca_ that were not mentioned in the main chapters:

  1. The board game of the Game of the Goose, which inspired Sanguineti;
  2. Gianfranco Baruchello's _Il Giuoco dell’Oca di Edoardo Sanguineti_ which was conceived to reinterpret the traditional board game in the light of Sanguineti's work. 

All selected items come with metadata that, when possible, adhere to international standards. For those using proprietary schemas, the metadata has been aligned with an appropriate standard from the corresponding domain.
