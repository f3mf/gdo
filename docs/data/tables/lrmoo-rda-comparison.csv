Criterion,CIDOC CRM + LRMoo,RDA
Focus,Formal ontology expressivity,Bibliographic cataloguing precision
Perspective,Temporal,Synchronic
Modelling patterns,"Historical relation pattern, typed properties",Property proliferation (generally seen as bad ontology design) 
Ease of querying,Item metadata must be reconstructed through the related events,Data are directly connected to the item they relate to
Inferencing potential,"Fine transitivity of partitive properties, including the chain of core links between WEMI levels",Limited to entailment from subclass relationship chain
Size,"Streamlined, 8 000~ axioms","Large, 80 000~ axioms"
Maturity,De facto standard for data integration in cultural heritage,"Still settling, but likely the foundation of semantic libraries"
LRM integration,"LRM classes and properties are inserted into the CIDOC CRM taxonomy, with some friction[^3]",Seamless
Reuse issues,Mandatory declaration of entities not relevant to the domain,Somewhat arbitrary breakdown between datatype and object properties
