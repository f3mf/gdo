# Introduction
<em>The Game of the Goose</em> is a project developed for the final assignment in the <em>Information Science and Cultural Heritage</em> course of the master's degree program in <em>Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge</em>. 
<br>The project objective is to analyze a specific domain within contemporary literary studies, focusing on the literary work <em>Il Giuoco dell'Oca</em> by Edoardo Sanguineti. Specifically, the project examines its unique combinatory structure and content.  

## Workflow
The following schema illustrates the workflow for the development of the project, starting from the analysis of a chosen domain to the representation and production of new data. Specifically, it emphasizes iterative and formal processes with the objective of transforming raw metadata and domain knowledge into a structured, reusable knowledge graph, leveraging ontology design and data modeling principles.
