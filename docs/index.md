# Introduction
_The Game of the Goose_ is a project developed for the final assignment in the _Information Science and Cultural Heritage_ course of the master's degree program in _Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge_.

The project objective is to analyze a specific domain within contemporary literary studies, focusing on the literary work _Il Giuoco dell'Oca_ by Edoardo Sanguineti. Specifically, the project examines its unique combinatory structure and content.  

### Workflow

The following schema illustrates the workflow for the development of the project, starting from the analysis of a chosen domain to the representation and production of new data. Specifically, it emphasizes iterative and formal processes with the objective of transforming raw metadata and domain knowledge into a structured, reusable knowledge graph, leveraging ontology design and data modeling principles.
